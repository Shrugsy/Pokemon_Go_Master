# Pokemon_Go_Master
copies of decoded Pokemon Go Master files to compare changes beginning with android game version 0.41.4
Additions since 0.41.4 master: In 0.45.0 master lines 1267-1272 contain templates for first catch and first pokestop of the day. Lines 24478 - 24510 contain templates and settings for "sequence_seq_transform" and "sequence_seq_transform_fast". This did not exist in previous master files.
I have no plans to update this with new versions. There are instructions available online for how to decode your own files with simple tools
